D.2 Server

   A minimal server implementation MUST be able to do the following:

     * Implement the following methods: SETUP, TEARDOWN, OPTIONS and
       either PLAY (for a minimal playback server) or RECORD (for a
       minimal recording server).  If RECORD is implemented, ANNOUNCE
       should be implemented as well.
     * Include the following headers in responses: Connection,
       Content-Length, Content-Type, Content-Language, Content-Encoding,
       Transport, Public. The capability to include the Location header
       should be implemented if the RECORD method is. RTP-compliant
       implementations should also implement the RTP-Info field.
     * Parse and respond appropriately to the following headers in
       requests: Connection, Session, Transport, Require.

   Though not required, the following are highly recommended at the time
   of publication for practical interoperability with initial
   implementations and/or to be a "good citizen".

     * Implement RTP/AVP/UDP as a valid transport.
     * Inclusion of the Server header.
     * Implement the DESCRIBE method.
     * Generate SDP session descriptions as defined in Appendix C

     There may be RTSP applications different from those initially
     envisioned by the contributors to the RTSP specification for which
     the requirements above do not make sense. Therefore, the
     recommendations above serve only as guidelines instead of strict
     requirements.

- "g" designates general request headers to be found in both requests and responses
- "R" designates request headers
- "r" designates response headers
- "e" designates entity header fields

Fields marked with "req." in the column labeled "support" MUST be implemented
by the recipient for a particular method, while fields marked "opt." are
optional. 

Note that not all fields marked "req." will be sent in every request of this
type. The "req."  means only that client (for response headers) and server
(for request headers) MUST implement the fields. 

The last column lists the method for which this header field is meaningful;
the designation "entity" refers to all methods that return a message body.
Within this specification, DESCRIBE and GET_PARAMETER fall into this class.
